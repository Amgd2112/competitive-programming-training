# Learning Map

## Kick Start

### C++ Fundamentals
There is a playlist for learning [C++ for competitive programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU370w1A-_k&list=PLPt2dINI2MIZPFq6HyUB1Uhxdh1UDnZMS) prepared by Mostafa Saad, one of the best Arab trainers. Alternative tutorials, it is recommended to learn the [C++ Tutorial From Basic to Advance](https://youtu.be/mUQZ1qmKlLY) prepared by Bucky on youtube.

If you already know the concepts of programming, then surely you need nothing more than these basics to start competitive programming.

### Warmup
The cool thing to do is learn from the experiences of others. Here Dr. Mostafa Saad gives us really good advice on thinking techniques.

As a warm-up, start solving [implementation problems](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/algorithms?filters%5Bstatus%5D%5B%5D=unsolved&filters%5Bsubdomains%5D%5B%5D=implementation&badge_type=problem-solving) in [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/).
