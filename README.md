# Competitive Programming Training

Competitive Programming is an art form. It is creative problem-solving at its finest, a combination of hard analytical thinking and creativity. Competitive programmers use their knowledge of algorithms and data structures and logical reasoning skills to solve challenging algorithmic problems in a limited time frame. 

## Master Typing
In order to compete, we need a fast hand, so at the beginning of training, we must learn how to write. This can be achieved by enjoying typing at [TypingClub](https://www.typingclub.com/).

**Required levels**

* Home, Top, and Bottom Row
* Basic Level 1, 2 and 3
* Advanced Level 1

Now, all keys on the keyboard are covered and you can kick start your journey.

## Programming Language 
Pick a programming language and stick with it. Learn the basic syntax and start solving beginner problems. It is preferred to start with one of these languages.

* C++
* Java
* Python

Java and C++ are extremely popular due to their relative run-time efficiency compared to a language like Python.

## C++ Installation
The [MinGW](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~pattis/common/handouts/mingweclipse/mingw.html) tootls for C/C++ is a complete runtime environment for gcc to support binaries native to Windows operating system.

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) combines the simplicity of a code editor with what developers need for their core edit-build-debug cycle. It provides comprehensive code editing, navigation, and understanding support along with lightweight debugging, a rich extensibility model, and lightweight integration with existing tools.

**Adding C++ and important extensions to VSCode**
  * [Material Icon Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme)
  * [Bracket Pair Colorizer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer-2)
  * [C/C++](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools)
  * [Code Runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.code-runner)

**Setup configurations on VSCode**
1. One thing to do is to turn on [Autosave](https://techdecodetutorials.com/visual-studio-code/enable-auto-save-in-visual-studio-code/) on settings.
2.  Adding [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html), A code style guide is a guide to what your source code should look like. It defines the appearance of the source code. To apply google style on VSCode we need to [set C_Cpp.clang_format_fallbackStyle to Google](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45823734/visual-studio-code-formatting-for) then we turn [Format On Save](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39494277/how-do-you-format-code-on-save-in-vs-code) on settings.
3.  The last thing to do is to [set up c++ debugger](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp).
